I don't remember when or why I got a little into the IEMs.
I've been using the Letshuoer S12 Pro for some years and I would say it is pretty good.
I changed the thick stock cable with the one from the Truthear Hexa.
The nozzle is quite short on the S12 Pro which may be uncomfortable for some so I recommend bigger sized eartips.
